# Developing a Handwritten Digits Classifier with PyTorch
### Project Summary
As a machine learning engineer, I've gained familiarity with deep learning, a powerful tool for a number of tasks â€“ not the least of which is computer vision. As part of a new product, I've been asked to prototype a system for optical character recognition (OCR) on handwritten characters. Since the team is still collecting data samples, I've been tasked with providing a proof of concept on the MNIST database of handwritten digits, a task with very similar input and output.

In this project, I will be given a Jupyter Notebook to do all of my coding and written explanations. I will preprocess a dataset for handwritten digit recognition, build a neural network, and then train and tune that neural network using my data.

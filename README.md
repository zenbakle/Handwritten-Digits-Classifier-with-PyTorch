# Developing a Handwritten Digits Classifier with PyTorch

### Project Summary
As a machine learning engineer, I've gained familiarity with deep learning, a powerful tool for a number of tasks â€“ not the least of which is computer vision. In this project, I was asked to prototype a system for optical character recognition (OCR) on handwritten characters as part of a new product development. Given that the team was still in the process of collecting data samples, I was tasked with providing a proof of concept using the MNIST database of handwritten digits, a task with very similar input and output.

In this project, I was provided with a Jupyter Notebook to do all of my coding and written explanations. My tasks included preprocessing a dataset for handwritten digit recognition, building a neural network, and then training and tuning that neural network using the provided data.
